<p><b><i>"A mind is a fire to be kindled, not a vessel to be filled."</i></b></p>
<p>College life is known as one of the most memorable years of one’s life. It is entirely different from school life. College life exposes us to new experiences and things that we were not familiar with earlier. For some people, college life means enjoying life to the fullest and partying hard. While for others, it is time to get serious about their career and study thoroughly for a brighter future.</p>
<p>My experience at <b>Madras Institute of Technology</b> has taught me one fundamental thing – life is unpredictable. It might be good, it might be bad, it might be weird, and it might not interest you, but expect anything to happen. For example, you might have a wonderful job this moment, and be fired the very next moment. College life prepares you for all of this. It is a perfect blend of joy and hardships. You meet different people, you interact with them, you learn about their cultures and grow as a person. You will understand how to talk to different people, how to judge their behavior, thus helping you with important life skills.
<p>My entry into this college after I had completed my school education was an important event in my life. I felt very much excited on the very first day. I found that there is a great difference between school and college life. The world of the school is narrow and limited. The world of the college is large. Teachers in a school are strict but College teachers are like elder brothers.</p>
There is a lot of freedom in the college. In the school I was busy from the first period to the last. But in the college I attend classes for three or four periods</p>
<p>it was very a wonderful time where we can enjoy as well as learn a lot of things.we had a lot of events and symposiums.As i belong to information technology department our important event and symposium was samhita.in this event i had a good time with my friends</p>
